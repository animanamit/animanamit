### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Animan, I'm a front end developer.

In 2022 I'm working on..
 - Bettering my React skills by building projects using popular libraries that are used by companies in production 
 - Learning Typescript by using it in place of Javascript as much as possible
 - Building my full stack skills by trying to create backends for my frontend-heavy projects.
